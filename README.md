#Training Reflection
I tried using node to test my code but I feel more comfortable using my browser console. I'm sure with time and practice, this will not be an issue
I ran into many syntax errors as I was testing because I was not mindful that I was creating an array in most cases; Must remember this! 
I was not able to complete the birthday countdown or pingpong challenge. The logic in the pingpong challenge is confusing to me.

* Please **Fork & Clone** this repo.
* For each problem, modify the relevant file in the `challenges`folder. We encourage you to *commit often* and push your changes to github.
* In your forked copy of this readme, add a short (3-5 sentence) reflection about your work to the top in a section titled "Training Reflection".
* You should include a link your forked repository on your personal website when you complete work.

## Challenges
1. [Letter Count](/challenges/letter-count.js)
2. [Query String Parser](/challenges/query-string-parser.js)
3. [Birthday Countdown](/challenges/birthday-countdown.js)
4. [Ping Pong](/challenges/ping-pong.js)

#### Key Concepts
* Working with **key-value pairs**
* Drilling into complex objects using **dot notation** and **bracket notation**
* Dynamically setting keys in **objects** (i.e. keys are not hard-coded).
* Using Array **iteration** methods.

## Executing your code
There are a number of options for running/executing your code. They all have their uses, so we encourage you to learn all of them:

- From the browser:
    - **Using the [Chrome Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/console/console-ui?hl=en#opening-the-console)**
        * Tip: Use `↑` and `↓` to cycle through your code history. Pressing `→` selects the current suggestion. If there’s a single suggestion, `Tab` to select it.
    + **Using [Javascript Snippets](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/snippets/)** to execute and save your scripts.
- From the command line:
    + **Using the [Node REPL / Shell](http://www.nodelabs.org/repl.html)**
        * Tip: Type `.exit` to quit. Use `↑` and `↓` to cycle through your code history.
    + **Using the [`node some-file.js` command](http://javascript.cs.lmu.edu/notes/commandlinejs/)**
        * Tip: Use `ctrl` + `c` (shortcut) to quit "hanging" programs. And make sure to `console.log("your output")`.
